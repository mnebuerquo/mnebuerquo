## Brought to you by Github Pages, Jekyll, and the number 404
I set up Jekyll, pushed to master on branch `mnebuerquo/mnebuerquo`, and the site wasn't found. It turns out that github was treating my site like a project page instead of a user page. When I put `/mnebuerquo/` after the url, I saw my page, but at the root there was a 404 error. I thought it must have been the `baseurl` setting in `_config.yml` but that looked correct. I spent about two hours googling Jekyll configuration to no avail. I tried using branch `gh-pages` too, but no change.

Then I was talking to [samhoice](https://github.com/samhoice) and he said "Oh. There's your problem. You named your repo wrong. You need to name it `mnebuerquo.github.io` instead of just `mnebuerquo`."

In the documentation: [user-organization-and-project-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/)

It's really obvious once you know what's up. I read that page in the docs a dozen times before samhoice pointed out the name error though.

So I felt a little dumb for missing that, but now I have a site where I can write about stuff that I've figured out.
